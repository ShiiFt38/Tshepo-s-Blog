<h1>All upcoming PS5 games: 2023, 2024, and beyond</h1>

The PlayStation 5 has been out for some time now, and its reception has been mostly positive. It includes lots of quality-of-life improvements over its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, such as faster load times, a solid-state drive (SSD) instead of a regular hard disk drive (HDD), and an improved controller in the form of the new DualSense. However, a console is only as good as the games available on it, and thankfully, the PS5 has you covered on that front as well.

While the machine already has a worthy library of great PS5 games, there are even more to look forward to, with some releasing as soon as this month, while others are still years away. In the video game world, it’s not uncommon to be aware of games that are still several years out from release. It’s also normal for a new game to be revealed and launched within just a couple of months. In this comprehensive list, we’ll go through the major PS5 releases scheduled for 2023 and speculate on future games.

Gaming Acquisitions to Increase in 2024, Sony Expected to Be an Active Buyer
Leading tech M&A investment bank Drake Star has said that it expects an uptick in gaming acquisitions, including PlayStation acquisitions, based on conversations it has had with “many of the top gaming companies.” Sony is expected to be one of the most “active” buyers starting in 2024.

Drake Star understandably didn’t say which “top” gaming companies it spoke to but told Axios that Tencent, Sony, and Take-Two Interactive will be among the most active buyers in 2024. There was no mention of Microsoft, which will presumably pause its acquisition activity for a while following the high-profile purchase of Activision Blizzard for a whopping $68.7 billion.

Microsoft has begun the process of integrating Activision Blizzard with Xbox Studios but is still facing a probe from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., which recently received the greenlight to examine the Microsoft-Sony Call of Duty deal as well. Meanwhile, Sony is reportedly under pressure to make a major acquisition of its own, per a recent report.

“Q4 [2023] has started on a great note with the era-defining gaming deal in Microsoft/Activision finally closing after a lengthy regulatory review,” Drake Star wrote in its report. “We expect M&A activity to steadily increase in 2024.”
